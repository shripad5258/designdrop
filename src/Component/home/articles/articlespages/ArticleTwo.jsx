              Domus is issued monthly with readers in over 100 countries and
              covers a wide array of topics. It was initially circulated as a
              guide for homemaking and domestic furnishing, but over the years,
              it has evolved into a nuanced assemblage of critical theory,
              intellectual debates, and articles ranging from interior to urban
              design.{" "}
